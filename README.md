- Event listeners handle delete functionality
- Real-time interactivity using `document.createElement`, `appendChild`, `removeChild`, etc.

### 🎨 CSS Flexbox
- Used for creating the **header layout**
- Logo, title, and navigation (if any) are aligned responsively across different screen sizes

### 🧱 CSS Grid
- Main task list layout is structured using Grid
- Responsive grid rows/columns to display tasks neatly on any screen
